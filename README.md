# SQL-challenge

For this challenge, I analysis six CSV files from Pewlett Hackard company. 

Here, I have designed ERD using Qucikdatabasediagrams.com to understand entity relationships with the database.  

Then, I engineered a schema for creating tables for each CSV files, also creating appropriate keys and composite keys to connect tables in SQL.

Finally, I have written SQL queries to answer the following queries for Pewlett Hackard employees using the database.
Data Analysis using SQL queries. 
•	List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.
•	List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.
•	List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.
•	List the department number for each employee along with that employee’s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
•	List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.
•	List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.
•	List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
•	List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).
